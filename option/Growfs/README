The Growfs option adds a startup command that will attempt to use
growfs to enlarge the FreeBSD partition.

This allows you to create and distribute a relatively small image that
will automatically expand to fill whatever media it is installed on.

For example, you could create a 1GB RaspberryPi image that would fit
on a small 1GB SD card but could also be copied onto a 32GB SD card.
In the latter case, the filesystem would be automatically expanded on
the first boot to fill the card.
