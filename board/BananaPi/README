BananaPi is supported by FreeBSD-CURRENT.

============================================================

What is a BananaPi?
--------------------

The BananaPi and BananaPi Pro are ARM-based development/test
boards.  They feature a modern ARMv7 processor and a wealth
of on-chip peripheral support.  Details can be found at:

   http://bananapi.org/

The BananaPi is an easy way to learn about ARM development: it is
inexpensive (about $40) and does not require any special skills or
hardware to use.  You boot it from a SD card with the system image.

Once you have the BananaPi working, you can expand it by connecting
it to Ethernet, adding USB peripherals (such as external disk drives
or wireless network interfaces) or attaching new hardware to the
connectors on the board.

============================================================

How to boot the BananaPi
--------------------------------

1. CONNECT the board to your FreeBSD (or other) system
   using a third-party adapter cable such as:
     Adafruit 954: http://www.adafruit.com/product/954
     FTDI TTL-232R-3V3 cable:  Widely available
     FTDI Friend adapter:  http://www.adafruit.com/products/284

2. ACCESS the serial console at 9600 baud.  Note: The Tx/Rx pins
   may be reversed.

3. INSERT the SD card into your BananaPi

4. POWER the board by connecting it to a 5v power supply

============================================================

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
-----------------------

If the image fails to boot:
  * Look at the build and install logs under the 'work' directory.
  * Ask on the arm@freebsd.org or freebsd-current@freebsd.org mailing list for
help.

============================================================

Anatomy of a BananaPi Boot Image
----------------------------------

The FreeBSD bootable image for BeagleBone has both FAT
and UFS partitions containing the following files:

  FAT Partition
     sunxi-spl.bin - First stage boot, from U-Boot
     uboot.img - Second stage: U-Boot

  UFS Partition
     /boot/kernel - dynamic kernel
     ... rest of FreeBSD ...

The boot process works like this:

 1) AM3358 SoC ROM code inspects the SD card, finds the MBR
    partition table and loads "sunxi-spl.bin" from the first FAT
    partition.

 2) sunxi-spl.bin loads uboot.img from the first FAT partition.

    U-Boot is a highly modular boot loader system that can be used on
    a wide variety of systems.  The loader is configured with built-in
    script commands that can be partially overridden by additional
    commands in the BB-uEnv.txt file.

 3) ubldr is a variant of FreeBSD's standard loader(8) program that is
    designed to be chain-loaded from U-Boot.  It calls into U-Boot for
    low-level device access, which allows ubldr to load FreeBSD on any
    system that supports U-Boot.

 4) ubldr locates the UFS partition, loads /boot/kernel/kernel from
    UFS to address 0x80200000 and executes it.

============================================================

NATIVE SOURCE REBUILDS
---------------------------------------

The usual "make buildworld", "make installworld",
"make buildkernel", and "make installkernel" all work
natively on the BananaPi.  Due to limited memory and
slow speed of SD, a full buildworld can take 30-40 hours:

 $ make buildworld
 $ make installworld
 $ make KERNCONF=CUBIEBOARD2 buildkernel
 $ make KERNCONF=CUBIEBOARD2 installkernel

If you want to try this, you'll want an 8G image.  You can put the
source tree into the image when you build it by including the
following in your config.sh:

  option UsrSrc
  option SwapFile 768mb

After you boot the resulting image, you'll have a fully populated
/usr/src and can try rebuilding the system natively.

Alternatively, of course, you can use "portsnap" to download and
install a ports tree, build the subversion port, and checkout the
FreeBSD source code using that.  This works, I've done it.

================================================================

PROJECTS
--------------------------------

If you're interested, there are a lot of things still to
be done:

* Use the system.  The stability has been generally improving
  but the more people use and stress it, the more issues we'll
  be able to shake out.  Report any problems on freebsd-arm
  mailing list.
* Test ports.  Many ports are known to work well; help us test
  and fix the rest!
* More drivers.  The A20 SoC has a lot of hardware
  components that are still unsupported.
