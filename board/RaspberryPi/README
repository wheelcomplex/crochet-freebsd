RaspberryPi is supported by FreeBSD-CURRENT as of
November, 2012.  Support is improving very rapidly
and the system is now at a point where many people
should be able to actually use the system.

========================================================================

What is RaspberryPi?
--------------------

RaspberryPi launched in early 2012 as an inexpensive ($35) PC
based on a Broadcom BCM2835 SoC.   It was developed by the
UK-based RaspberryPi foundation as an inexpensive system for
educational use.

Having been designed as a PC (rather than as a development/experimenter
board), it has a slightly different focus than some similar
systems:
 * Emphasis on low cost.
 * Built-in video (HDMI and composite)
 * Relies on standard consumer accessories:  can be powered from
   a common micro-USB charger, uses USB keyboard, consumer television
   display, etc.

The RaspberryPi has been wildly successful (over a million
units sold) and has attracted a large following.

How to Boot the RaspberryPi
---------------------------

As of January 2013, FreeBSD-CURRENT fully supports either
a video console (you'll need a USB keyboard and display
connected) or it can be configured to use a serial console
(you'll need a serial adapter cable such as the one sold by
Adafruit.com).

After connecting video, keyboard, and inserting the SDHC card,
you connect power to actually boot.

============================================================

IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
-----------------------

If the image fails to boot:
  * Look at the build and install logs under the 'work' directory.
  * Ask on the freebsd-arm@freebsd.org or freebsd-current@freebsd.org
    mailing list for help.

Anatomy of a RaspberryPi Boot Image
----------------------------------

The FreeBSD bootable image for RaspberryPi has both FAT
and UFS partitions containing the following files:

  FAT Partition
     LICENCE.BRO - Broadcom copyright and license
     BOOTCODE.BIN - Second stage boot (First stage is ROM code)
     CONFIG.TXT - Configuration file used by start.elf
     RPI.DTB - Binary FDT, loaded by start.elf
     RPI.DTS - Source version of FDT, for reference
     START.ELF - GPU firmware
     FIXUP.DAT - Used by start.elf to partition SDRAM between GPU and CPU
     U-BOOT.IMG - Third stage: U-Boot loader
     UENV.TXT - Configuration file for U-Boot (empty by default)
     UBLDR - FreeBSD bootloader

The following are used if the GPU video memory is configured to be 16MB:
     START_CD.ELF - Alternate version of START.ELF
     FIXUP_CD.DAT - Alternate version of FIXUP.DAT

  UFS Partition
     /boot/kernel - dynamic kernel
     ... rest of FreeBSD ...

More details on RaspberryPi boot sequence can
be found in the README file in the "boot"
directory.
